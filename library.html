        <p><strong>Aadujeevitham is a novel portraying the real life of Najeeb who was a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia. My father bought this book for me to read. On this occasion, I would like to thank him for giving me such a wonderful book. This novel made me understand the real problems of people working abroad. When I started reading the book, I had many expectations, whether the novel is about goats or the life of a person which is like goats.
            The story tells us about the life of Najeeb who went abroad to fulfill the small dreams in his life, leaving his pregnant wife at home. But unfortunately, instead of reaching Riyadh, he reaches a goat rearing farm somewhere in Saudi Arabia. He gets trapped by the supervisor who is shown as a brutal and cruel man. Najeeb was forced to look after the goats. He was starving quite a lot and at other times, he was given 'khubboos' and cold water. He did not have many clothes to wear. He was not allowed to take baths as the supervisor considered it as a waste of water. As a whole, I felt that he was not even getting the considerations that the goats got. His job was to take the goats to the nearby hilly area to feed them. He spends almost all his time with the goats, eating and sleeping with them. Nobody was there to speak with him. The only Keralite was a truck driver whom he met very rarely. So he found satisfaction himself by speaking with the goats. He assigned names to each goat and spoke to them. He wrote letters to his wife though he knew that he couldn't send them. He never wrote the hardships he faced in these letters. He tried his level best to withstand and survive through all the difficulties he faced and never tried to commit suicide. He was surrounded by the vast desert and he tried to find shelter, even behind stones. Whenever he tried to escape from there, he was caught by the supervisor. Najeeb feels that he has become a goat, living with the goats. Finally, he escapes from there.
                This is a real life story and I cannot even start to imagine how hard it would have been. This is a book that brings tears to the eyes of the reader. There are many people who go abroad, legally or illegally, who fall in the traps of heartless agents and merciless job providers. The cover of the book quotes, "All life which we didn't experience are just fables for us." One gets to experience the pulse of a person who suffered a lot in the desert, by reading this book. I highly recommend everyone to read this novel, Aadujeevitham.

<li>ORU SANKEERTHANAM POLE</li>
<img src="orusankeer.JPG">
<p><strong>Oru Sankeerthanam Pole made publishing history in Malayalam. What could be the cause of this unusual combination of unprecedented popularity and critical acceptance?

    The author himself has described his work in these simple words: “It carries God’s signature.” It is a work soaring towards sublimity. Dostoevsky has said somewhere that God and Satan swayed him in equal measure. I think Perumpadavam brought out the God element of Dostoevsky in his work as triumphing over the Satan element. The affirmative quality of the novel and the felicitous style of Perumpadavam have clearly captivated readers.
    
    In spite of the phenomenal success of the Malayalam original, why do you think your English translation Like A Psalm… wasn’t picked up by any major publisher? Is there a bias at work?
    
    Books have particularly interesting destinies. Instances of supremely recognized books being steadily rejected by major publishing houses in the earlier stages of their journey are too numerous to quote. I had submitted the manuscript of this novel to several publishers, many of them personal friends, over a decade from 2005 to 2015. Somehow none of them picked it up. Finally, when a colleague who retired from Sahitya Akademi took up a senior executive’s job in LiFi, he began reaching out to me to help him gather manuscripts while I was teaching English in Libya in 2013. I gave him Like A Psalm…, and here we are.
    
    Perumpadavam tried to explore the psyche and life of Dostoevsky who was far removed from him in terms of culture, geography and time. How did the author bridge this huge chasm?
    
    Human imagination is capable of reaching even unnamed galaxies. So, culture, geography and time merely turned into tools for Perumpadavam’s powerful imagination. He has said on several occasions that reading Dostoevsky’s works, which he did in his boyhood and youth, was like an actual journey into the aforementioned three elements.
    
    Are there elements of magical realism in this novel?
    
    Magical realism is a very tricky term and has close associations with the dark political scenarios in South American countries. More often than not, dictators held the populace to ransom. To recreate those experiences in the minds of the people during the sway of oppressive regimes, treatment of actual events as fantastic, surreal happenings which caught the primordial tribal imagination, like in the novels and novellas of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others, had to be resorted to. Perumpadavam didn’t need to resort to that technique. He has been employing psychological realism like his idol, Dostoevsky, did.
    
    English is a language with tremendous descriptive power, but is said to be poor in perception, while Malayalam is considered more powerful in perception.
    
    It’s not like that. English, with its plethora of shades of meaning for words, can be very rich in perception, as they can delve deep into the hidden world of meanings. Malayalam has its own characteristics, while English has its own too. Translation from the former to the latter becomes successful when equivalences for words and expressions are satisfactorily found in the target language</strong></p>

    <li><strong>KAALAM</strong></li>

        <strong>As I had said here... Am a  proud matrilineal nair woman !!! While this did set me apart from many of my peers, I really never appreciated the dynamics of it... All I knew was tht a few generations back in a typical Nair family the father never played active role in upbringing his children instead it was the maama(moms bros!)! While I hv heard a few snide comments on this abt 'Crafty Nair Women'(N I take a bow for it :-P)~~ I never knew enuf to what this setup translated to for this is never a topic thats come up for a discussion in my family circle (Well guess they had graver topics to worry abt!)

            Haaa now b4 u ask me if this post wasnt supposed to be an book review ~~ Lemme dig in n introduce you to the book 'Kaalam' by M.T. Vasudevan Nair ~~ Haa but ofcourse the fraud mallu I am, I read an English translation of it by Gita KrishnanKutty ~~ A gr8 shes done with the book!
            
            So as you must hv guessed the book revolves around the 'matrilineal Sambandham' system ~~ N heres a brief decko of the system  ~~ The lady continues to stay at her home(her mothers place if u prefer) post marriage while husband keeps paying her on-n-off visit(While this aint written anywhere how many of you would waana guess the 'Days-of-the-month' the husband will come visiting :-P) So but obviously the men-in-House would be the girls brothers and so their significance n so the matrineal system too!
            
            Now while this is jus a decko am sure theres more to it... From the hear-say what I know is this is followed to avoid the wealth n property from being partioned ~~ While I am still to understand the chemistry of how matrilineal system prevents partition n such I can vouch with some level of accuracy that while today matrilineal system ot not the wealth does gets partioned but the rate may still be a degree lessser ~ Possibly to do with the closer bonds that a sister - sister as compared to a sister - SIL (N who are you kidding if u say tht the shots at a home is not called by the women!) or possibly cause this prevents a man from floundering all his wealth on his family(read wife n children) at cost of others  as well the key stakeholders here are the women( C'mon the chances of women floundering off wealth is much lesser!)
            
            
            Ok now the above para was a digression from the book!  The story in 'Kaalam' revolves around the the family dynamics of a not-so-well-to-do Nair Families n the downfall of Namboodiris......   A book tht gives u a insight into the fibre of kerala society..... A nice good read!</strong>
