Anyone who ever tried their hand at writing will know how painful and exhilarating the journey is. The pain & joy of this art is captured in the pages here. Perumbadavam captures a fictional biography of Dostoevsky in this beautiful work.


What stands out is the simplicity and clarity of this book. It delves deep into the mind of this writer. It tells you of the first buds of love emerging from the hardened fields of his mind, it tells you of his failures and furstration, a bout of writers block and how in the end he over comes it all.Let me be upfront and say that I have never read Dostoevsky and probably never will in the near future. When I retire and have cobwebs in my mind, I will shine the light of Dostoevsky to know myself.

The beauty of this work is how Perumbadavam summarises the Russian : An author with the signature of God imprinted on his heart . (less)
